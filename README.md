## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

The third challenge I undertook to polish my fron-end development skills. Throughout the previous challenges, I understood that there were still ways for me to refine my code and make it easier to understand and maintain. The sole goal of this challenge was to deepen my understanding of front-end development and to hone my skills.
